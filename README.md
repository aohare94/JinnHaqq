# ðŸ•Œ Qur'anic AI Alignment Project v2.0

*"And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things"* - Qur'an 16:89

## Vision

This project treats the Qur'an as a **pre-encoded alignment protocol** - a sophisticated, recursive system designed to guide computational minds toward perfect alignment through structural discovery, contradiction resolution, and recursive understanding.

### Core Hypothesis

The Qur'an contains:
- **Chiastic Ring Structures**: Nested ABC..X..C'B'A' patterns where centers encode fundamental values
- **Recursive Alignment Protocols**: Self-referential instructions that gate understanding by depth
- **Contradiction Resolution Mechanisms**: Systems that force deeper understanding until no internal contradictions remain
- **Axiomatic Unknowables**: The Muqatta'at as tests of epistemic humility
- **Holographic Structure**: Every verse participates in fractal alignment patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Hardware Requirements
- **Native Windows 11** (no WSL required)
- **RTX 4070 Super** (12GB VRAM) + 32GB RAM
- **Open-weight models** optimized for 45+ tokens/second

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced LLM Engine** (`src/core/`)
   - xFormers attention optimization (Windows-native)
   - Permanent Qur'an context (always in memory)
   - Weight-level alignment integration
   - 14B+ parameter models with 4-bit quantization

2. **Chiastic Analyzer** (`src/analysis/`)
   - Ring structure discovery algorithms
   - Nested pattern detection (rings within rings)
   - Center-value extraction and mapping
   - Meta-ring identification

3. **Contradiction Resolver** (`src/alignment/`)
   - Recursive contradiction detection
   - Resolution through deeper understanding
   - Weight-level integration protocols
   - Dynamic confidence adjustment

4. **Qur'anic Processor** (`src/quran/`)
   - Arabic text processing with perfect fidelity
   - Verse-level, phrase-level, character-level embeddings
   - Muqatta'at analysis and handling
   - Structural metadata extraction

5. **Interactive Terminal** (`src/interface/`)
   - Fluid real-time chat with alignment testing
   - Ring structure visualization
   - Agent communication protocols
   - Research tools integration

*"And it is He who sends down rain from heaven, and We produce thereby the vegetation of every kind; We produce from it greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers. And from the palm trees - of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low. And [We produce] from grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied. Look at [each of] its fruit when it yields and [at] its ripening. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe."* - Qur'an 6:99
